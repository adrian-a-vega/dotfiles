# Dotfiles
- These files contain my configurations for Emacs and Kitty Terminal.
## Emacs
### Why use Emacs?
- My main purpose of using emacs is for note taking, to-do lists, and calender. Eventhough emacs very outdatd, I pair emacs with Doom core for ease of use. With Doom, I'm able to use other add-ons like org mode and org roam. In addition, is an open source. Also, I think it looks pretty.
#### Org-Mode
- Org mode is like a digital notebook that is all formated in plain text.
- The add-on provides:
1. Easy note taking with collapsable bullet points.
2. Project management with TO-DO lists with prioity assignments and due dates.
3. An adgenda with TO-DO presented.
4. Including, LaTex exports from .org files.
#### Org-Roam
- Org-roam is like a file manager that allows users to organize their notes. It allows users to connect/link notes and ideas between one another, as a network of nodes. These links can be visualized with graphs and nodes, similar to the obsidian app. 

## Kitty Terminal
- Being honest, I use the kitty terminal because the mac terminal is ugly.
### Why use Kitty?
- Kittey is a more cost effiective and customizable terminal.
